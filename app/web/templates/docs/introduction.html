<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Welcome to the docs</p>

<h2>What is Barbell?</h2>
Barbell is an <i>open</i> platform for AI in <abbr title="First Robotics Competition">FRC</abbr>.
Barbell allows teams to upload raw match images and download polished datasets for development.

<h3>Project Goals</h3>
<ul>
    <li><i>Raise</i> the limits of AI in FRC</li>
    <li></li><i>Lower</i> the requierments to inovate</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why Barbell exists</h2>
After the 2025 FRC season, I started thinking about the role of AI object detection in competition.
I found that most teams where doing basic gamepiece detection, but only a select few were doing 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-PIHN8kKPE">more</a>. I also needed somthing to do over
the summer. So, I started development on Barbell. It ended up taking longer then I thought, but I
am proud of how it has turned out.

<h2>Who is Barbell for?</h2>
Barbell is for <i>anyone!</i> It is primarly for FRC teams, but you can also use it as an individual,
whether as a resercher, developer, or if you're just curious. Just <a href="/register">create an account</a>
