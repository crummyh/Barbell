# RIGHT NOW THIS IS VIEW ONLY! It is for me only to work on, at least until I get to alpha. Everything here is temporary and *will* be changed. You will find a CD topic when I am ready. See you then :wave:

# frcVisionDataset

An *open* dataset allowing <abbr title="FIRST Robotics Competition">FRC</abbr> teams to upload match images, and download object detection datasets.

> [!WARNING]
> This project is in ***pre-alpha*** as of June 24, 2025. Everything is still at the "it works on my machine" point, except it doesn't even work for me! :sweat_smile:

### Running Locally
Linux:
```bash
# Pre-requirements
# * Have git installed
# * Have Python 3 installed

# Setup
git clone "https://github.com/crummyh/frcVisionDataset.git"
cd frcVisionDataset
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Now start working!
# To run the app run:
fastapi dev app/main.py
# When you are done run:
