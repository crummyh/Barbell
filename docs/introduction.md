## What is Barbell?

Barbell is an *open* platform for AI in FRC. Barbell allows teams to upload raw match images and download polished datasets for development.

### Project Goals

*   *Raise* the limits of AI in FRC
*   *Lower* the requirements to innovate

## Why Barbell exists

After the 2025 FRC season, I started thinking about the role of AI object detection in competition. I found that most teams were doing basic game-piece detection, but only a select few were doing [more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-PIHN8kKPE). I also needed something to do over the summer. So, I started development on Barbell. It ended up taking longer then I thought, but I am proud of how it has turned out.

## Who is Barbell for?

Barbell is for *anyone!* It is primarily for FRC teams, but you can also use it as an individual, whether as a researcher, developer, or if you're just curious. Just [create an account](/register) and [get started!](/docs/quickstart)
